# Stock Prices using Monte-Carlo method

Project made during a course on Python in Optimization and Finance with Pr. O. Gu√©ant that deals with
Monte-carlo simulations of stock prices with optimization of optimal exit time.
Here, we suppose that stock prices follow a Geometric Brownian Motion without drift.
